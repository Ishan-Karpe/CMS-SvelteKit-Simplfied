  - Map out all sponsor-related content including promotional text, bullet points, and demo section
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Create content validation utilities
  - Write a function to search for sponsor-related terms across the codebase
  - Implement pattern matching for "Kiln AI", "getkiln.ai", and related sponsor content
  - Create validation checks to ensure complete removal
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [X] 3. Implement sponsor content removal
  - Write code to remove the identified sponsor section from README.md
  - Ensure clean removal without affecting surrounding content structure
  - Maintain proper markdown formatting and prevent orphaned sections
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Add comprehensive validation and testing
  - Create tests to verify sponsor content is completely removed
  - Implement checks for markdown structure integrity after removal
  - Add validation to ensure no sponsor references remain in any project files
  - Write tests to verify proper content flow and formatting
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Execute removal and validate results
  - Run the sponsor removal implementation on the actual README.md file
  - Execute comprehensive validation checks across the entire codebase
  - Verify the README maintains proper structure and readability
  - Confirm no sponsor-related content remains anywhere in the project
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
